This data set was created on December 11, 2021, and the data was first published on December 6, 2021. The data is sourced from the City of New York. There is not much information concerning the specific method of collecting data; however, the data was collected for the New York City Department of Education, who likely used surveys to find out the relevant information about students who attended New York City district schools from the beginning of the school year to July 2 over the course of the 2020-2021 school year.\nEach observation is based on a DBN (District Borough Number) and a school’s name. For each observation, there are different variables to identify the number of total students, the percentage of students in temporary housing, the number of students residing in shelter, the number of students residing in a DHS (Department of Homeless Services) shelter, the number of students residing in a non-DHS shelter, and the number of students living in “doubled up” housing, which means that they are living in households with multiple families due to the financial inability to live in their own home."

Further, we look to explore how what school the student attended impacted the likelihood of housing instability during this time period.\nOur hypothesis is that students who attended a public school during the 2020-21 school year had a higher likelihood of experiencing housing instability than their privately-educated peers.\nWe also hypothesize that students who are educated at private schools were more likely to experience doubling up housing insecurity rather than living in shelters. On the other hand, we hypothesize that students educated at public schools experienced living in shelters as a a form of housing instability at a higher rate than those who were educated in private schools.\nThere are both quantitative and categorical variables in my research question:\nThe categorical variable for our first research question is type of education (private or public), and the quantitative variable for our first research question is percent of students in temporary housing.\nThe categorical variable for our second research question is type of education (private or public), and the quantitative variables for our second research question are # of students residing in shelter and # doubled up."

    "text": "Literature\nThe New York Times article, published on October 26th, 2022, explores the challenges faced by homeless students in New York City’s public schools. According to the article, there are over 111,000 homeless students enrolled in the city’s public schools, a number that has swelled from roughly 78,000 a decade ago. Closson writes about the circumstances that the students face, including inadequate housing, lack of access to food and medical care, and high levels of stress and trauma. It is a huge challenge to provide support and resources to these students, given limited funding. Despite this, the article also highlights positive efforts being made like “Bridging the Gap,” a program that aims to provide academic and emotional support to homeless students. Overall, it paints a complex picture of difficult challenges faced by homeless students in NYC; while there are significant obstacles, there are also efforts underway to make real, tangible change.\nThe article expands on our leading question of the correlation between public schools and housing insecurity. It details the homeless crisis up close and also provides statistics such as the graduation rate of highschool students living in shelters (60%). However, there is a focus on public schools. We hope to expand on these findings be exploring the differences between students with housing insecurity in public schools in comparison to those who attend private schools. Further, looking at data directly from 2021 - 2022, we are exploring the state of child homelessness and instability, something that was potentially exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and economic struggles.\nClosson, Troy. “More than 104,000 New York City Students Were Homeless Last Year.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 26 Oct. 2022, https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/26/nyregion/nyc-homeless-students.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur."

However, this project looks to understand whether there is a correlation between race and the type of arrest. Different types of arrests include warrant-based, on-view, and summoned/cited. Our goal is to determine whether a certain race is more likely to be arrested when a warrant is present or whether a certain race is more likely to be arrested “on-site” (or when a police officer suspects that they had engagement in a criminal act - probable cause for an arrest on-site). We also hope to integrate sex into this question, to examine the how intersectionality may exacerbate biases.\nWe hypothesize that there would be a correlation between Black men arrested and the fuse of on-site arrests. We also predict that there may be a correlation between White women and the use of warrants to arrest.\nFor this question, most of the variables will be categorical. We are specifically focusing on three variables in this case, race, sex, and type of arrest, which all serve as categorical variables."

They emphasize such discrimination through startling statistics including the fact that African Americans are 5.9 times as likely to be incarcerated than Whites and are far more likely to be both arrested and convicted. Explaining the root cause of such inequities, The Sentencing Project states that “the experiences of the poor and minority defendants within the criminal justice system often differ substantially from that model due to a number of factors, each of which contributes to the over-representation of such individuals in the system.”\nWe look to expand off of this report, looking into how the type of arrest itself can also be biased against certain races. In integrating sex into this question, we are also further exploring the relationship between race and sex and how it influences discrimination within the criminal justice system.\nThe Sentencing Project. “Report to the United Nations on Racial Disparities in the U.S. Criminal Justice System.” The Sentencing Project, 19 Apr. 2018, https://www.sentencingproject.org/reports/report-to-the-united-nations-on-racial-disparities-in-the-u-s-criminal-justice-system/"

As a result of being the busiest time of the year, factors such as weather, staffing shortages, and equipment issues have a much more significant impact on schedule disruption. Just last year, low-cost carriers like JetBlue and Spirit canceled 10.3 and 9 percent of flights in April. The article also provides advice on how to minimize the impact of flight delays: book direct flights and choose early morning departures. It’s also smart to avoid flying during weekends. Most importantly, though, “never book the last flight of the day.” Additionally, Murphy writes about the implications these cancellations have on airlines, damaging them both financially and reputation wise. New technologies may be implemented, but, at “the heart of the issue,” airlines respond to supply and demand, increasing flights when people travel more.\nThe NYT article offers a deeper glimpse into why certain times of the year result in more delays and cancellations. It also provides insight into factors such as departure time and flight (direct) routes. However, our research is slightly different from this article as it is based more recently and illustrates the impact of the pandemic.

    "text": "Methodology\nTo begin our exploratory data analysis, we created scatterplots using the facet_wrap() function to separate the data for each of the airports. The visualization below displays the number of flights cancelled at each of the top five busiest airports in the United States by season.\n\n\n\n\n\nExamining this visualization, we noticed that almost all of the airports had the highest number of cancellations during the winter months. Of the five, ORD (O’Hare) had the most cancellations during the winter months. LAX (Los Angeles) was the only airport where the highest number of cancellations was not during the winter months.\nThe visualization below displays the number of flights delayed at each of the top five busiest airports in the United States by season.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we observed that highest number of delays across the five airports occur either during the summer and winter months. ATL (Atlanta) had the highest number of delays of the five airports during the summer months while ORD (O’Hare) had the hightest number of delays during the winter months.\nWe also wanted utilized the summarize() function to calculate means.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  atl_mean_cancel atl_mean_delay\n            <dbl>          <dbl>\n1            567.          6924.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  den_mean_cancel den_mean_delay\n            <dbl>          <dbl>\n1            236.          3331.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  dfw_mean_cancel dfw_mean_delay\n            <dbl>          <dbl>\n1            532.          4326.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  lax_mean_cancel lax_mean_delay\n            <dbl>          <dbl>\n1            225.          3522.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  ord_mean_cancel ord_mean_delay\n            <dbl>          <dbl>\n1            950.          6480.\n\n\nAccording to this mean data, on average, O’Hare has the highest number of flight cancellations while Atlanta has the highest number of flight delays.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  winter_mean_cancel winter_mean_delay\n               <dbl>             <dbl>\n1               762.             5240.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  spring_mean_cancel spring_mean_delay\n               <dbl>             <dbl>\n1               467.             4756.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  summer_mean_cancel summer_mean_delay\n               <dbl>             <dbl>\n1               466.             5677.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  fall_mean_cancel fall_mean_delay\n             <dbl>           <dbl>\n1             316.           3989.\n\n\nAccording to this mean data, on average, the highest number of flight cancellations occur during the winter months while the highest number of flight delays occur during the summer months.\nTo continue to explore our research question, we utilized linear regression modeling. A linear regression model is most appropriate as we are utilizing a categorical variable (seasons) to help answer our research question. To determine the relationship between the number of cancellations and seasons and to determine the relationship between the number of delays and seasons, we will use a simple linear regression model. We will also utilize an interactive multiple linear regression model to estimate the relationship between a quantitative variable (either the number of delays or the number of cancellations) and two explanatory variables (both seasons and airport codes). In this case, multiple linear regression is helpful because multiple variables are connected to the output (in this case, the number of flight delays or cancellations). Specifically, we will use an interactive linear regression model as the inclusion of the airport code variable impacts the relationship between the number of cancellations/delays and the season. Finally, we will utilize r-squared and AIC to determine whether the interactive models or the simple models are better fits for the data."

    "text": "Results\nFirst, we created a simple linear regression model to determine the relationship between the number of flights delayed and the season.\n\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 5\n  term         estimate std.error statistic   p.value\n  <chr>           <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)     3989.      160.     24.9  1.79e-100\n2 seasonSpring     768.      231.      3.32 9.38e-  4\n3 seasonSummer    1688.      226.      7.45 2.47e- 13\n4 seasonWinter    1251.      228.      5.49 5.49e-  8\n\n\nIn this case, we observe that the mean number of delays that occur in the fall at each airport is approximately 3988.68 (intercept). The coefficient associated with the summer season is both positive and most significant, indicating that the highest number of flight delays occur in the summer months across the five selected airports.\nWe then created a simple linear regression model to determine the relationship between the number of flights cancelled and the season.\n\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 5\n  term         estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  <chr>           <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)      316.      33.9      9.34 1.09e-19\n2 seasonSpring     151.      48.9      3.08 2.12e- 3\n3 seasonSummer     150.      47.9      3.13 1.82e- 3\n4 seasonWinter     445.      48.2      9.23 2.71e-19\n\n\nHere, we observe that the mean number of cancellations that occur in the fall at each examined airport is approximately 316.45 (intercept). The coefficient associated with the winter season is most significant, indicating that the highest number of flight cancellations occur in the winter months across the five selected airports. This makes sense as the inclement weather (snowstorm, hail, etc.) increases the cancellations in winter, while vacationing and traveling frenzies push delays during the summer.\nWe then created an interactive multiple linear regression model to illustrate the relationship between the number of flight delays, the season, and the airport code.\n\n\n# A tibble: 20 × 5\n   term                         estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n   <chr>                           <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>\n 1 (Intercept)                    6022.       264.   22.8    9.37e-88\n 2 seasonSpring                    441.       381.    1.16   2.47e- 1\n 3 seasonSummer                   2337.       373.    6.26   6.36e-10\n 4 seasonWinter                    792.       375.    2.11   3.53e- 2\n 5 Airport.CodeDEN               -3593.       373.   -9.63   9.08e-21\n 6 Airport.CodeDFW               -2597.       373.   -6.96   7.40e-12\n 7 Airport.CodeLAX               -3100.       373.   -8.31   4.50e-16\n 8 Airport.CodeORD                -876.       373.   -2.35   1.91e- 2\n 9 seasonSpring:Airport.CodeDEN    302.       538.    0.561  5.75e- 1\n10 seasonSummer:Airport.CodeDEN   -884.       528.   -1.68   9.41e- 2\n11 seasonWinter:Airport.CodeDEN    620.       531.    1.17   2.43e- 1\n12 seasonSpring:Airport.CodeDFW    422.       538.    0.784  4.33e- 1\n13 seasonSummer:Airport.CodeDFW   -653.       528.   -1.24   2.16e- 1\n14 seasonWinter:Airport.CodeDFW    268.       531.    0.505  6.14e- 1\n15 seasonSpring:Airport.CodeLAX    -26.5      538.   -0.0492 9.61e- 1\n16 seasonSummer:Airport.CodeLAX  -1261.       528.   -2.39   1.70e- 2\n17 seasonWinter:Airport.CodeLAX    112.       531.    0.212  8.32e- 1\n18 seasonSpring:Airport.CodeORD    936.       538.    1.74   8.24e- 2\n19 seasonSummer:Airport.CodeORD   -444.       528.   -0.841  4.01e- 1\n20 seasonWinter:Airport.CodeORD   1298.       531.    2.44   1.47e- 2\n\n\nAt the Atlanta airport in the fall, we expect there to be about 6021 delayed flights (intercept). From this data, we do notice that the season with the highest number of flight delays varies between airport. For Atlanta, we observe that the coefficient associated with the summer season is the highest, indicating that summer has the highest number of delays in Atlanta. However, it is important to note that not all five of the airports have the highest number of delays in the summer.\nOur second interactive multiple linear regression model illustrates the relationship between the number of flight cancellations, the season, and the airport code.\n\n\n# A tibble: 20 × 5\n   term                         estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n   <chr>                           <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>\n 1 (Intercept)                     362.       60.9     5.94  4.40e- 9\n 2 seasonSpring                     67.0      87.9     0.762 4.46e- 1\n 3 seasonSummer                    213.       86.2     2.48  1.35e- 2\n 4 seasonWinter                    538.       86.7     6.20  9.43e-10\n 5 Airport.CodeDEN                -223.       86.2    -2.59  9.86e- 3\n 6 Airport.CodeDFW                 -36.9      86.2    -0.428 6.68e- 1\n 7 Airport.CodeLAX                -164.       86.2    -1.91  5.71e- 2\n 8 Airport.CodeORD                 197.       86.2     2.28  2.27e- 2\n 9 seasonSpring:Airport.CodeDEN     28.4     124.      0.229 8.19e- 1\n10 seasonSummer:Airport.CodeDEN   -157.      122.     -1.29  1.99e- 1\n11 seasonWinter:Airport.CodeDEN   -297.      123.     -2.42  1.58e- 2\n12 seasonSpring:Airport.CodeDFW    201.      124.      1.62  1.06e- 1\n13 seasonSummer:Airport.CodeDFW    -72.7     122.     -0.597 5.51e- 1\n14 seasonWinter:Airport.CodeDFW   -110.      123.     -0.897 3.70e- 1\n15 seasonSpring:Airport.CodeLAX    -73.6     124.     -0.592 5.54e- 1\n16 seasonSummer:Airport.CodeLAX   -206.      122.     -1.69  9.17e- 2\n17 seasonWinter:Airport.CodeLAX   -431.      123.     -3.51  4.68e- 4\n18 seasonSpring:Airport.CodeORD    263.      124.      2.11  3.48e- 2\n19 seasonSummer:Airport.CodeORD    118.      122.      0.968 3.33e- 1\n20 seasonWinter:Airport.CodeORD    376.      123.      3.06  2.28e- 3\n\n\nAt the Atlanta airport in the fall, we expect there to be about 362 delayed flights (intercept). From this data, we do notice that the season with the highest number of flight cancellations varies between airport. For Atlanta, we observe that the coefficient associated with the winter season is the highest, indicating that winter has the highest number of cancellations in Atlanta. However, it is important to note that not all five of the airports have the highest number of cancellations in the winter.\nTo compare the fit of the simple linear regression models with the fit of the interactive multiple linear regression models, we calculated an r-squared and an AIC value for each of the models.\nR-squared values for the delay simple and multiple linear regression models (respectively):\n\n\n[1] 0.07468645\n\n\n[1] 0.508484\n\n\nR-squared values for the cancellation simple and multiple linear regression models (respectively):\n\n\n[1] 0.1055727\n\n\n[1] 0.4341787\n\n\nAIC values for the delay simple and multiple linear regression models (respectively):\n\n\n[1] 13885.64\n\n\n[1] 13436.83\n\n\nAIC values for the cancellation simple and multiple linear regression models (respectively):\n\n\n[1] 11525.64\n\n\n[1] 11209.63\n\n\nComparing the linear regression model without airport codes (model1) for flight delays with the interactive regression model that takes airport codes as a second variable (model2) for flight delays, we observed that the interactive model is a better representation of the data than the simple model. The r-squared for the interactive model is closer to one than the simple model, and the AIC for the interactive model is smaller than the AIC for the simple model, both indicating that the second model, the interactive model, better represents this data.\nWe found the same results comparing the two models (the simple model and the interactive model) for the flight cancellation data. The r-squared for the interactive cancellation model is closer to one than the simple cancellation model, and the AIC for the interactive cancellation model is lower than the AIC for the simple cancellation model."

    "text": "Discussion\nBased on our statistical analysis, we were able to find that the season with the highest number of delays among the top five busiest airports was summer. The season with the highest number of cancellations among the top five busiest airports was winter. As we also created a interactive multiple linear regression model to explore whether the airport interacted with the season to impact the level of flight delays, we were able to conclude that the season was not the sole variable impacting whether flights were cancelled or delayed. It is important to note that there are a few limitations with our research. Primarily, we only examined the five most busy airports which is a small portion of the airlines data set, ultimately decreasing the reliability of our conclusions. We also only thoroughly examined the impact of seasons on delays and cancellations. There are other variables that may be more useful in impacting the number of delays or cancellations (ex. airport codes, airlines, etc.). Further research should more deeply examine how airports impact flight delays or cancellations and should explore what most commonly causes such flight delays and cancellations."
