This data set was created on December 11, 2021, and the data was first published on December 6, 2021. The data is sourced from the City of New York. There is not much information concerning the specific method of collecting data; however, the data was collected for the New York City Department of Education, who likely used surveys to find out the relevant information about students who attended New York City district schools from the beginning of the school year to July 2 over the course of the 2020-2021 school year.\nEach observation is based on a DBN (District Borough Number) and a school’s name. For each observation, there are different variables to identify the number of total students, the percentage of students in temporary housing, the number of students residing in shelter, the number of students residing in a DHS (Department of Homeless Services) shelter, the number of students residing in a non-DHS shelter, and the number of students living in “doubled up” housing, which means that they are living in households with multiple families due to the financial inability to live in their own home."

    "text": "Literature\nPublished on July 1st, 2022, the NYT article “Understanding the Summer Air Travel Mess” discusses the challenges faced by travelers during the summer months due to mass delays and cancellations. As a result of being the busiest time of the year, factors such as weather, staffing shortages, and equipment issues have a much more significant impact on schedule disruption. Just last year, low-cost carriers like JetBlue and Spirit canceled 10.3 and 9 percent of flights in April. The article also provides advice on how to minimize the impact of flight delays: book direct flights and choose early morning departures. It’s also smart to avoid flying during weekends. Most importantly, though, “never book the last flight of the day.” Additionally, Murphy writes about the implications these cancellations have on airlines, damaging them both financially and reputation wise. New technologies may be implemented, but, at “the heart of the issue,” airlines respond to supply and demand, increasing flights when people travel more.\nThe NYT article offers a deeper glimpse into why certain times of the year result in more delays and cancellations. It also provides insight into factors such as departure time and flight (direct) routes.\nMurphy, Heather. “Understanding the Summer Air Travel Mess.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 1 July 2022, https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/01/travel/summer-travel-flight-delays-cancellations.html."
